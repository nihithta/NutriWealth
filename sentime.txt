6. Web Application: Community Mental Health Support Platform
Problem Statement: Create a web application designed to facilitate community-driven mental
health support by connecting users with peers, therapists, and wellness resources. This
platform should offer AI-powered mood tracking, access to mental health resources, and
anonymous forums for users to seek support, all while using NLP to ensure user safety and
detect distress signals.
Challenges to Address:
● Natural Language Processing: Implement NLP models to detect negative sentiment or
distress in user interactions.
● User Safety: Develop real-time alerts for crisis intervention while ensuring user
anonymity and security.
● Personalization: Provide tailored resources and support based on individual needs and
emotional states.
● Data Privacy Compliance: Ensure strict privacy measures to protect sensitive mental
health data.
